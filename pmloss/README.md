# PM-Loss: PointMap Loss

This package provides a PyTorch implementation of **PM-Loss**, a novel training loss introduced in the paper "Revisiting Depth Representations for Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting".

PM-Loss is designed to improve the quality of feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models by addressing geometric artifacts that arise from depth map discontinuities. Our method leverages a complete and coherent pointmap, generated by a pretrained 3D reconstruction model like VGGT, as a pseudo-ground truth. The loss then regularizes the predicted 3D Gaussian centers against this prior using a single-directional Chamfer distance, resulting in significantly better geometric and rendering quality.

## Installation

You can install the `pmloss` package in two ways:

### Option 1: Direct Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aim-uofa/PM-Loss#subdirectory=pmloss
```

### Option 2: Install from a Local Clone

If you want to modify the code or contribute to the project, you should install it from a local copy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aim-uofa/PM-Loss

# Then, navigate into the repository's root directory and install the package
cd PM-Loss
pip install ./pmloss
```
